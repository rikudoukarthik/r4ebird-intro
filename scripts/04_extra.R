# Exercises --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Create a function that takes values in km and converts them to miles. (1 mile ~ 1.6 km)
#    Output the results for four different input values.

# 2. Calculate list length (number of species reported) for each checklist.
#    (HINT: What is the "grouping" variable here? Can we take all lists, or only unique lists?)

# 3. Get a list of 5 LEAST common species for your own district.

# 4. In your personal eBird data, calculate number of species reported every year (or month).
#    If possible, visualise it as a bar chart or line graph. (geom_point() and geom_line())

# 5. In your personal eBird data, find the 10 species you have most commonly observed.
