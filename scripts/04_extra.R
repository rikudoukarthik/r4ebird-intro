# Exercises --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Calculate list length (number of species reported) for each checklist.
#    (HINT: What is the "grouping" variable here? Can we take all lists, or only unique lists?)

# 2. In your personal eBird data, calculate number of species reported every year (or month).
#    If possible, visualise it as a bar chart or line graph. (geom_point() and geom_line())

# 3. In your personal eBird data, find the 10 species you have most commonly observed.
